The dashboard will focus on providing insights into:

- **Regional Sales Performance**: Track how different regions are performing in terms of total sales.
- **Top-Selling Products and Categories**: Identify the best-selling products and product categories.

## Visualizations
The following visualizations will be included:

1. **Total Sales and Profit by Region**: Scatter chart showing total sales and Profit across different regions.
2. **Top Products and Category**: Bar chart list of top-performing products and categories.
3. **Quarterly Sales Growth**: Line chart showing the sales growth over time.
4. **KPIs**: A set of cards or tiles displaying the main KPIs (total sales, total profit).

## Usage
- Use the dashboard to analyze **regional performance**.
- Track **top-selling products** and adjust strategies accordingly.
